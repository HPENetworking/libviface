libvifacecpp : C++ bindings for Linux tun/tap and netdevice interface
==================================================================

``libvifacecpp`` is a small C++11 library that allows to create and configure
virtual network interfaces in Linux based Operating Systems.

::

   #include "viface/viface.hpp"

   // Create interface
   viface::VIface iface("viface%d");

   // Configure interface
   iface.setMAC("66:23:2d:28:c6:84");
   iface.setIPv4("192.168.20.21");

   // Bring-up interface
   iface.up();

Then you can ``send()``, ``receive()`` or setup a ``dispath()`` callback to
handle virtual interfaces incoming and outgoing packets. Also, interface
statistics (rx/tx packets, bytes, etc) are available to read using
``readStat()`` and related functions.

For a complete overview check the reference documentation and examples.


Features
========

- Object Oriented approach to create virtual interfaces.
- Multiple strategies for packet reception and emission.
- Interface configuration API (MAC, Ipv4, IPv6, MTU).
- Interface statistics reading and clearing.
- Easily integrated with ``libtins``.


Dependencies
============

::

   sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake doxygen graphviz


Build
=====

::

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   make doccpp


Improvements
============

- Improve and fix possible race conditions when up/down is issued (and thus
  packet buffer based on MTU is resized) and a dispatcher is active or any
  other IO is active.
